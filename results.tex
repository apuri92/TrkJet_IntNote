The \Dptr\ distributions for \pp\ and \pbpb\ can also be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:dptr_pbpb_pp}. There is a kink at $R = 0.4$, which is an artifact of the jet reconstruction algorithm that has distance parameter $R = 0.4$ and it is present also at the particle level distributions. Furthermore, it can be seen that jets are being more collimated with the increasing jet \pt, with almost no high \pt\ tracks seen outside the jet cone. The \Dptr\ distributions become broader with decreasing charged particle \pT. The largest fraction of particles in the jet core carries \pT\ in the interval between 4 and 6~GeV.

Figure~\ref{fig:rdptcent} shows \RDptr\ as a function of \rvar\ for seven \pt\ selections: 1.0--1.6~\GeV, 1.6--2.5~\GeV, 2.5--4.0~\GeV, 4.0--6.3~\GeV, 6.3--10.0~\GeV, 10.0--25.1~\GeV\ and 25.1--63.1~\GeV\ for \pbpb\ collisions in all centrality bins. It can be seen that in central collisions, charged particles
with $\pt <$~4.0~\GeV, \RDptr\ grows with increasing \rvar\ for $r <0.3$, is approximately constant for
$0.3 < r <0.6$, and goes down for $0.6 < r < 0.8$.  For $\pt > $~4.0~\GeV\ \RDptr\ decreases with increasing \rvar\ for $ r < 0.3$
and is approximately constant for $ 0.3 < r <0.8$.
For peripheral collisions, \RDptr\ has an enhancement for the lowest \pt\ particles ($\pt < 2.5$ GeV), with higher \pt\ particles showing a decreasing \RDptr\ with increasing \rvar. Intermediate \pt\ particles ($2.5 < \pt < 10 $ GeV) do not show any significant \rvar\ dependence.

The \Rdptr\ distribution can be integrated over $ \rvar < 0.4 $, which can then be directly compared to the ATLAS 5 TeV \pbpb\ fragmentation function result \cite{ATLAS502FFConf}. This comparison is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:FF_comparison_jet1}-\ref{fig:FF_comparison_jet4}. It can be seen that both measurements agree within the systematic uncertainties for all \ptjet\ bins used in the analyses. Any differences come from the the different methods of UE estimation used in the two analyses, where even small differences in the UE lead to large variations in the subtracted distributions because of the poor signal to background ratio.

Figure~\ref{fig:ptjetdep} shows the \ptjet\ dependence of \RDptr\ for two \pt\ selections: 1.0--1.6~\GeV\ and
6.3--10.0~\GeV.  Charged particles from the lower \pt\ selection have an \RDptr\ which increases as 
with increasing \ptjet\ at all  \rvar.  The higher \pt\ charged particles
have an \RDptr\ value which decreases with increasing \rvar, but which is consistent for all \ptjet\ selections.

It can be seen that in most central collisions, yields of low \pt\ charged particles ($\pttrk \lesssim 4$ GeV) is enhanced in \PbPb\ collisions compared to \pp\ collisions for $r \lesssim 0.8$. This excess is monotonically increasing from $r=0$, reaching the maximum around $r\approx0.4$ and then decreasing. Yields of higher \pt\ particles with $\pttrk > \approx 4$ GeV show are suppressed in \PbPb\ collisions compared to the \pp\ reference across the entire $r$ range except for the core of the jet where a small excess is seen for the yields of charged particles with the highest \pT. This is in the agreement with the observation in the measurement of the inclusive jet fragmentation functions where the yields of the high-$\pT$ fragments are observed to be enhanced in \PbPb\ collisions compared to the \pp\ reference~\cite{ATLAS502FFConf}. This enhancement of fragment yields with high $\pt$ was recently discussed in terms of the expected stronger quenching of  gluon jets than quark jets~\cite{Spousta:2015fca} and within a hybrid strong/weak coupling model of jet quenching~\cite{Hulcher:2017cpt}.  The size of the modification to the charged particles yields gradually decreasing with the  decreasing collisions centrality. Furthermore, the magnitude of the excess of low transverse momentum particles increases with increasing jet transverse momentum. The enhancement of fragment yields at low \pT\ is consistent with models of the jet quenching where the energy lost by fast partons is transferred predominantly to soft particles outside the jet cone and it might result from the response of the medium to the partonic shower. This is further suggested by the observation of dependence of the magnitude of excess on the jet \pt.
